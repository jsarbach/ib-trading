## Algorithmic trading with Interactive Brokers (IB)

These are the code samples behind my Medium articles about algorithmic trading with IB on the Google Cloud Platform. There are two different implementations:

* Kubernetes, see [Building my own Cloud-based Robo-advisor]
* Cloud Run, see [Run, Gateway, Run! &ndash; Algorithmic Trading the Serverless Way]

Use at your own risk. ;-)
